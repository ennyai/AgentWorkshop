- Put Enny logo top left banner

- Change body text to "Join our free 1-hour zoom webinar to learn how to automate your content creation process. Perfect for business owners, marketing professionals, and creators. No technical experience required"

- Take out second and third third bullet points (excel & engineer) and replace with "Save hours of work every week" and "Improve your brand presence online"

- Live Content Automation Demo

Watch as we take a simple idea and transform it into complete social media content— IG, LinkedIn, X, and more—in real-time. You'll see the exact tools and workflow we use to create content automatically.

- Take out video

- What you'll learn in the Free Webinar: Change "cost reduction" icon title to "time reduction" and change icon to an arrow pointing down

- Take out "content you can automate" section - it's redundant and we won't actually be doing anything with email campaigns in the webinar

- Take out "benefits for content creators & team" - redundant

- Content automation success stories: I'd change this title to Enny client reviews or at least the logo carousel of clients that's on the Enny website.

- Move sign-up form section to above "What You'll Learn in the Free Webinar" section

- Take out "What You'll Learn" section that's at the very bottom
